- I'm creating social media app backend project here. Create a 'package.json' file with basic project information (name, version, description, main entry point). Use 'npm init -y' equivalent configurations.
- Add 'express' as a project dependency (updated package.json and added express)
- Create a main application file (created index.js with base setup)
- @terminal run this app (gave error for missing node_modules - did npm i and worked)
- Add a '.gitignore' file to exclude 'node_modules'

- Add 'body-parser' middleware to parse request bodies (both URL-encoded and JSON).
- Add 'cors' middleware to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (for development, you might allow all origins initially, but consider security for production).
- Implement basic logging middleware using 'morgan' to log HTTP requests
